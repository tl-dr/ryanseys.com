As you may or may not have noticed, I uplifted my website theme this past weekend. Most of the kinks are out, but there are still a few I need to address related to mobile and general typography. Do not be alarmed if you notice this site cycle through a few different fonts, I will be feeling them out in the next week or so and it may take me some time to warm up to them.

Any suggestions or general feedback is greatly appreciated! :)
