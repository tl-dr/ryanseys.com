<h3>About</h3>
<p>
  I'm Ryan. I'm a software engineering undergrad at Carleton University, a passionate web developer and open-source advocate. I love to invent, build and <code>git push</code> on a regular basis. Some of my favourite things include caffeine, photography, and just thinking about stuff.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently working at Top Hat as a Software Developer, helping enrich student engagement in the classroom.
